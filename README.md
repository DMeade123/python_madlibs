1 - I chose the 1st challenge to expand on the current story using other variables to create a more unique madlibs story
I chose that challenge because I had to delete and repeat my environment multiple times. I was having issues with github connections, so this ended up taking me to the last minute to get it finished. Overall, this challenge was chosen because I can get it done in a pinch.
Question 1 - The most interesting part of adding the feature is nesting loops inside each other to continuously generate repeat features. 
Question 2 - Obstacles face was getting the github repository to update to main from local devices terminal as well as navigating and updating specfiic branches. I overcame it through trial and error, did a lot of rebuilds on this project.
Question 3 - Creating a branch was unique because it allowed me to create a new feature based on already created code space, allowing me to just add to code block, test, and reimplement into main code branch. 
Question 4 - I feel comfortable with while loops, if statements, print statements, and input statements now.
